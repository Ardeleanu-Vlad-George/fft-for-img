# Purpose
Implement a FFT algorithm that actually processes images. All images are expected to be square with their sizes powers of two so that the 
 algorithm may be applied properly. The 'data' folder stores all images, an image is selected based on it's name that was given through the 
 command line. No checks are done to see that the names are correct, that the dimensions are respected, all of this are just assumed by the 
 program and assured by the developer.
Inside the 'data' folder, images are divided by whether they are for input or output, and then further divided by their sizes.
Project is using ISO 1998 version of the C++ language.
